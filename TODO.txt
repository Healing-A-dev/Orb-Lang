TODO LIST:

FEATURES:
	- Implement Modules:
		- Anything inside of a module should be ignored until the module is called
		- Must exit safely without interrupting the main program (until an error OUTSIDE of the module is encountered)
		- Must throw a compiler warning if something went wrong in the module
		- Cannot use an exessive amount of resources, as they will be compiled everytime they are called (for total isolation from the main program besides given arguments)

	- Finish Implementing Arrays:
		- Make values in an array callable (ex. Names{1})
		- Make values reassignable
		- Zero based indexing...?
			- I kinda like 1 based indexing though...I just makes sense..

	- Create an assembly compiler:	[WIP]
		- Compiles Orbit source code into assembly via 'Xohe'
		- Will use something known as "As is values", meaning no mathematical or concatenation operations will happen at compile time
		- There will be NO functions or anything of that sort either

		- Create an assembly wrapper in lua (MAYBE | NOT LIKELY) [DONE]
			- Be able to run and compile assembly files using an assembly wrapper written in lua

	- Create a simple Lua transpiler:	[CORE COMPLETED: Need to fixs arguments being converted to their orbit variable table values ex. VARIABLES.TEMPORARY.x1.VALUE should just be x1]
		- FIX: Random crap being added to the function calls (ex. VARIABLES.GLOBAL.a.Value = :=main():=main()main())
		- Converts Orbit functions & modules into Lua
		- Runs functions/modules, but only updates variables in Orbit
			- Converters the function/module into lua code that will be ran using the load() function
			eg:

			Orbit Code:
				func add(x1,x2) {
					ret x1 + x2
				}

				z = add(x,y)

			Lua Code:
				function add(x1,x2)
					return Variables.temporary[x1].Value + Variables.temporary[x2].Value
				end

				Variables.static.z.Value = add(x,y)

		- May be included in the x-oVM (Will have to rewrite in orb to ONLY update values and not compile again...because yeah...saving reasources and time)
	
BUG FIXES:
	- Fix concatenation [WIP]
	- Fix quotations in comments not working [throws unfinished string error] (DONE..? NO....)
